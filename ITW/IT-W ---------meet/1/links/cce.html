    <p><strong>About Department :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Department of civil engineering has been functioning since 2011 and has grown into a full-fledged department with specializations in all the major areas of Civil Engineering. The department has produced several eminent engineers who have made significant contributions in the planning and execution of Civil Engineering projects in India as well as abroad. The department has highly qualified faculty members engaged in teaching with the aim of achieving excellence in various fields. The faculty members are specialized in different disciplines of Civil Engineering.</li>
</ul>

<li>Civil Engineering deals with creating designs, constructing and maintaining physical structures including rails, roads, bridges, buildings, dams, etc. Civil Engineering is one of the highly critical engineering domains where a perfectly built structure can facilitate people with much comfort but a minor mistake made by an engineer can take away hundreds of lives in seconds. So, deep knowledge and perfect understanding of the concepts and requirements of civil engineering is highly desirable. This perfection in learning starts with the search of a good engineering college whose only aim is to produce highly skilled professionals with adequate knowledge and competency. LDRP-ITR is the <a href="https://www.marwadiuniversity.ac.in/programs/be/civil-engineering/">Best Civil Engineering College in Gandhinagar</a> and Ahmadabad Region end up this search by providing highly quality and reliable teaching and training curriculum and facilities to the students.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The department has well equipped laboratories, namely mechanics of solids, structural analysis &amp; software labs, concrete technology lab, soil mechanics lab, Environmental Engineering lab, Earthquake Engineering lab, Highway Engineering lab and surveying lab. The state of art infrastructure including high speed internet facility keeps the students well in advanced for various fields</li>
